# Super-Mario-Game


Collaborating with a team member, we designed this Super Mario Game, which was tried to make as similar as the original game as possible. 
It uses Python to implement the game logic, including Mario's movement, enemies, rewards and blocks of the game, as all the interactions between all of them.
We created a user-friendly interface for input and display, that allows to visualize the game in 2D.
